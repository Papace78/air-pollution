| Pollutant     | Main Source | Health Effects |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **O₃**        | Formed by chemical reaction between traffic emissions and solvents | Respiratory irritation, worsens asthma |
| **CO**        | Vehicles, poorly ventilated heating appliances | Headaches, nausea, severe poisoning at high levels |
| **SO₂**       | Burning of coal, oil, sulfur-rich gas | Irritates airways, triggers asthma attacks |
| **NO₂**       | Road traffic, combustion processes | Lung inflammation, respiratory problems |
| **NO (NOₓ)**  | Vehicles, power plants | Impairs lung function, chronic effects |
| **PM10**      | Traffic, heating, industry | Respiratory irritation, cardiovascular diseases |
| **PM2.5**     | Combustion (heating, engines) | Penetrates deep into lungs, heart and lung disease |
| **PM1**       | Industry, urban combustion | Can reach alveoli and bloodstream |


future work:
- Calculate global Air Quality Index
- Define healthy to unhealthy levels for each pollutant
- Relate to meteorological phenomena (temperature, pressure, winds ?)
- Relate to certain political decision
- Clear outliers in the data
